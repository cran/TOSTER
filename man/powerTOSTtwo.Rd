\title{Power analysis for TOST for independent t-test (Cohen's d).}
\usage{
powerTOSTtwo(alpha, statistical_power, N, low_eqbound_d, high_eqbound_d)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{alpha used for the test (e.g., 0.05)}

\item{statistical_power}{desired power (e.g., 0.8)}

\item{N}{sample size per group (e.g., 108)}

\item{low_eqbound_d}{lower equivalence bounds (e.g., -0.5) expressed in standardized mean difference (Cohen's d)}

\item{high_eqbound_d}{upper equivalence bounds (e.g., 0.5) expressed in standardized mean difference (Cohen's d)}
}
\value{
Calculate either achieved power, equivalence bounds, or required N, assuming a true effect size of 0.
Returns a string summarizing the power analysis, and a numeric variable for number of observations, equivalence bounds, or power.
