\title{Power analysis for TOST for correlations}
\usage{
powerTOSTr(alpha, statistical_power, low_eqbound_r, high_eqbound_r)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{alpha used for the test (e.g., 0.05)}

\item{statistical_power}{desired power (e.g., 0.8)}

\item{low_eqbound_r}{lower equivalence bounds (e.g., -0.5) expressed in standardized mean difference (Cohen's dz)}

\item{high_eqbound_r}{upper equivalence bounds (e.g., 0.5) expressed in standardized mean difference (Cohen's dz)}
}
\value{
Returns a string summarizing the power analysis, and a numeric variable for the number of pairs needed
