TOSTER v0.3.2 (Release date: 2018-04-14)
==============

Changes:

* Error in sensitivity analyses of powerTOSTpaired.raw, powerTOSTone.raw, powerTOSTtwo.raw where output was in Cohen's d - now changed to output in raw scores, added sd to examples. (thanks to Lisa DeBruine)
* Raw power functions still output ceiling N in message, but exact N in output value

TOSTER v0.3.1 (Release date: 2018-04-06)
==============

Changes:

* Error in TOSTpaired.raw where t-test for TOST multiplied by sdiff (copied from TOSTpaired function) removed. CI were correct, but p-values did not match. Now tests are correct. (thanks to ontogenerator)
* Changed text in TOSTr function (text copied from t-test script now changed to correlation)
