TOSTER v0.3.1 (Release date: 2018-04-06)
==============

Changes:

* Error in TOSTpaired.raw where t-test for TOST multiplied by sdiff (copied from TOSTpaired function) removed. CI were correct, but p-values did not match. Now tests are correct.
* Changed text in TOSTr function (text copied from t-test script now changed to correlation)
